# CodeMashBlueFruit


This is a repository to store the presentations and code examples for the CodeMash 2022 Maker Space "Bluefruit" project.

SCAD files contain source code for generating the 3d printed parts. Download OpenSCAD to edit them. 

STL files are generated from SCAD and can be sliced for 3d printing.

The .py files are Circuit Python, intended to run on the Adafruit Bluefruit 4333 Circuit Python device.

Refer to BlueFruitInstallInfo PDF file for detailed information on setting up the Bluefruit device. High level steps are also listed on the CodeMash Maker Space page.
