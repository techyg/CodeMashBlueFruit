# CodeMashBlueFruit


This is a repository to store the presentations and code examples for the CodeMash 2022 Maker Space "Bluefruit" project.

SCAD files contain source code for generating the 3d printed parts. Download OpenSCAD to edit them. 

STL files are generated from SCAD and can be sliced for 3d printing.

The .py files are Circuit Python, intended to run on the Adafruit Bluefruit 4333 Circuit Python device.

Instructions:

1. Clone or download Zip of repository
2. Ensure that you are running v7 of the firmware (uf2 file). 
3. Copy all .py files, and the lib folder to the root of your CIRCUITPY USB drive.
4. Rename or copy any Demo file and name it "code.py" in the root directory of your CIRCUITPY USB drive to run it on your Bluefruit.
5. I recommend opening and running the file with the Mu editor as well.
